# Data is beautiful
Some data analysis Jupyter notebooks, mainly indented for submissions on the subreddit [/r/dataisbeautiful](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/).


## Structure of the project
Each directory in this repository contains an own project in form of a Jupyter notebook. There should be a file called `requirements.txt` containing the dependencies to run that notebook.
